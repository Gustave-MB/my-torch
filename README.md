# MyTorch: A Custom Deep Learning Library

## Overview

Welcome to MyTorch, a deep-learning library implemented from scratch! This series of assignments represents a comprehensive effort to build a custom deep-learning framework inspired by PyTorch and appying knowledge gained to a Kaggle class competitions. P1 holds the files for MyTorch, while P2 consists of notebooks used for competitions. MyTorch is designed to empower users to create a wide range of neural network architectures, from fundamental multilayer perceptrons (MLP) to advanced models like convolutional neural networks (CNN), recurrent neural networks with gated recurrent units (GRU), and long-short term memory (LSTM) structures.

## Developed in 11-785 Introduction to Deep Learning at CMU

MyTorch was developed as part of the coursework for the "11-785 Introduction to Deep Learning" at Carnegie Mellon University. Through hands-on assignments, students had the opportunity to implement their own deep-learning library, gaining valuable insights into the inner workings of neural networks.

## Key Features

- **From Scratch Implementation:**
  These assignments showcase the implementation of a deep-learning library entirely from scratch. By building MyTorch, you gain a deep understanding of the fundamental components that power modern deep learning frameworks.

- **Inspired by PyTorch:**
  MyTorch draws inspiration from PyTorch, a widely-used deep-learning library. The design and functionality of MyTorch are influenced by PyTorch's ease of use and flexibility, providing users with a familiar yet customized experience.

- **Supported Architectures:**
  MyTorch supports the creation of various neural network architectures, enabling users to implement multilayer perceptrons, convolutional neural networks, and recurrent neural networks with GRU and LSTM structures.

- **Comprehensive Understanding:**
  Through the assignments, you will delve into key concepts such as forward propagation, loss calculation, backward propagation, and gradient descent. These fundamental concepts form the backbone of deep learning and are implemented explicitly within MyTorch.

## Auto-Grader Tests

- **Validation Against PyTorch:**
  The assignments include auto-grader tests that rigorously compare the outputs of MyTorch methods and class attributes with a reference PyTorch solution. This ensures the correctness and reliability of MyTorch's implementation.

- **Explicit Components:**
  To enhance transparency, the necessary components of MyTorch classes and class functions are made as explicit as possible. This encourages a deep understanding of the underlying mechanisms and facilitates learning for users of varying expertise levels.
